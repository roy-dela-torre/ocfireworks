                            <p>The Company ships all orders in excellent condition. The fireworks are inspected and the boxes we use are designed to protect fireworks during shipment. The Company recommends that you inspect the firework boxes as soon as you receive your order while the delivery driver is present. If the exterior of any box is visibly damaged (e.g., water damage, rips, major dents, etc.), the Company recommends that you open the boxes while the delivery driver is present and take note of any damaged fireworks. You must contact the Company immediately after your discovery of the damaged goods and we will work with you to resolve the issue. If you discover that the fireworks have been damaged after you receive your order and the driver has gone, please call the Company and let us know the details. We will attempt to work with you to solve any problems; however, due to the hazardous material classification of fireworks by the USDOT, the Company will not accept any returns on fireworks under any circumstances or for any reason.</p>
