Fireworks must be shipped hazmat freight (YRC, R+L, ABF, Etc).

                        <p>Hazmat Freight: Once the items have shipped, please stay up to date with the tracking. After a day, contact the freight company and follow what is happening with your shipment as the freight companies will no longer be contacting you for delivery arrangements. Contacting the freight company will give you the best chance to get your order quickly and allow you to plan to be home when the freight arrives.</p>

If this is the case, once the shipment has reached the destination terminal, the freight company may try to reach you by phone before they deliver. If they cannot, your order will sit in their warehouse; after 3-4 days, they will add storage fees to your order which you will be responsible for paying before they deliver your order. After 5-7 days of not being able to contact you, the freight company will deem your order as “abandoned,” and your order will be sent to a hazardous materials disposal company for proper disposal. Your order will be destroyed. If this happens, the company that disposes of your order will send us a bill for the safe and legal disposal of YOUR hazardous materials shipment and we will have to pay for this service. NO REFUNDS WILL BE ISSUED TO CUSTOMERS WHEN THIS HAPPENS…SO DON’T BE “THAT GUY” PLEASE ANSWER THE PHONE AND/OR COMMUNICATE WITH THE FREIGHT COMPANY.</p>

The total cost of this is typically around $500.</li>
