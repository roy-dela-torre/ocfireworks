                                <p>A: Shipping Fireworks is delicate and highly regulated. Zones 1, 2, and 3 should expect a minimum of 7-10 business days. Zones 4 and 5 should expect 10-15 business days. We always recommend curbside-pickup for those within a reasonable driving distance from our location in Indiana. Non-hazmat items generally take 3-7 business days for all Zones.</p>

                                <p>A: All fireworks are shipped via common carrier (Tractor Trailer or Large Box Truck) to your home or business. Your Ship to location must be able to accept freight shipments. We strongly advise you to arrange for delivery to a work or business address. This will reduce both the delivery time and shipping complications. All orders will require an adult signature for acceptance of your orders and in some cases your I.D must be present.</p>

                                <p>A: Delivery drivers are not responsible for unloading your order. Packages will be placed on the tailgate of the truck. If you need the cartons lowered down from the back of the truck you must select the optional (Liftgate Delivery Service) that is available to you at the time of checking out. If your order is unable to be delivered to your home, you are responsible for picking up your order from the nearest terminal. The trucking company will call you 24 - 48 hours ahead of time to schedule your delivery using the phone number you provide during the checkout process.</p>

                                <p>A: You may want to consult with the state, county or local officials in the area that you will be shooting fireworks. Even in states where fireworks are permitted, certain counties and cities may have additional restrictions. Your local fire department will usually be aware of local firework laws in your area. Note that in many areas it is illegal to shoot fireworks unless you have a permit. Please consult with your local officials in order to obtain a permit. When you agree to our Purchasing and Hold Harmless Agreement you are stating that you have all necessary permits. It is your responsibility, not that of Overstock Central Fireworks, to ensure that you can legally possess these fireworks. People not having permits where required run the risk of fines and/or confiscation of fireworks without any recourse to us or the shipping company.</p>
